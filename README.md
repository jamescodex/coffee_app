# Buy Me a Coffee dApp (Decentralized Application)

This is a decentralized application (dApp) built using JavaScript and React that allows users to support content creators by sending them virtual "coffee" as a form of appreciation. The dApp leverages blockchain technology to enable transparent and secure transactions without the need for intermediaries.

## Features

- Send virtual "coffee" to content creators as a way of supporting their work.
- View a list of supported content creators and their coffee balances.
- Real-time updates of coffee balances as transactions occur.
- Connect and interact with the dApp using a supported Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

## Prerequisites

Before running the dApp, make sure you have the following requirements met:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) installed on your browser.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/buy-me-a-coffee-dapp.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd buy-me-a-coffee-dapp
```

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Access the dApp by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Make sure you have your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to the appropriate network (e.g., Rinkeby).

7. Interact with the dApp by selecting a content creator, specifying the amount of coffee to send, and confirming the transaction using your Ethereum wallet.

## Configuration

The dApp configuration can be modified by editing the `src/config.js` file. Here are the available configuration options:

- `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The Ethereum address of the deployed smart contract that handles the coffee transactions.
- `CONTRACT_ABI`: The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract, which defines its functions and events.
- `NETWORK_ID`: The network ID of the Ethereum network the dApp is connected to (e.g., 4 for Rinkeby).
- `NETWORK_PROVIDER`: The network provider URL for connecting to the Ethereum network.

Make sure to update the configuration according to your specific deployment details.
